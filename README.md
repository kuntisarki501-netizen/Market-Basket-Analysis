# Data Analysis Project

##  Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and model building using Python. The goal is to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and evaluate results to extract meaningful insights from a structured dataset.

The implementation is primarily done using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
Structured dataset in CSV format
Used for data analysis and predictive modeling
Preprocessing steps applied to:
  Handle missing values
  Clean and transform features
  Prepare data for modeling

## Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection and scaling
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Result interpretation

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be applied to analyze datasets, build predictive models, and derive useful insights for decision-making.

## Future Improvements
Implement advanced machine learning models
Improve feature engineering techniques
Perform hyperparameter tuning for better model performance
